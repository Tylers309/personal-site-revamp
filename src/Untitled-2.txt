Hello my name is Tyler Sutton. I am a 17 year old
web designer and developer in Meridian, Ms. I've been 
making websites for a little over two years now and am 
looking for a place to break into and gain some experience
in the industry. I currently work as Head Groundskeeper
for the Meridian Airport Authority and have been for 
a year and a half.

I have experience designing, building, and deploying websites
from scratch. I have built websites for Meridian Aviation,
Deans Aircraft Service, Terie Shields Interior Design and sites for
family members as well. Here is a resume and a link to my personal site.
I'm excited about the idea of working for a company like y'all in 
my hometown.

Thank you.
